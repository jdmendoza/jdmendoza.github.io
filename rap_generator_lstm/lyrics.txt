nine light years away just outside of the kepler solar system
we find ourself consumed and utterly mesmerized
with a story of a young rebel against the system
refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
he chose the mood of "fuck this shit"
at that moment the one known as jacques turned to scott
chose to jump off his mama porch and lead the stampede of lost souls
in the middle of their metamorphosis not quite through with their journey
ain't made it through whatever the fuck they gon' be in life
but whatever it is it's better than here
so fuck you and fuck this
no monogamy ménage with me
pornography surrounding me

picture being locked in a box
selling beats cause you need dollars
they say i can make to the league mama
500 dollars all we need mama
then we gon' be on
tired of seeing the lights off
pops heatin' up the stove
was close to stealing and killing just to get 'em on
couple drinks down of rosé
i'm tipsy y'all faces look like an emoji
the rav four turned into a rover
til' it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
now my money a little longer
lookin' back how we finnesin' we ain't know shit
they gave me three got twenty five on the low
who knew that lump sum will get me on
my fifty seconds last a little longer longer
i can shit all day diaper
call that eat all day itis
will i ever fall off i doubt it
no no no
all these diamonds shinin'
all this gold on me all these foes on us
how do i dodge these zombies
they want my soul from me
know that i'm gone but one thing
they will never catch me
falling off falling off
never catch me falling off
falling off never catch me
falling off falling off
never catch me falling off falling off
never catch me falling off falling off
