**Deep Learning to Forecast Wikipedia Page Views**

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jdmendoza/wikipedia_time_series_forecasting) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jdmendoza/wikipedia_time_series_forecasting/blob/master/Wikipedia_Language_LSTM.ipynb)

Description: Using two years worth of page-view data for 145k wikipedia pages in eight different languages, I trained one LSTM to forecast for the eight different time series.

**Startup Recommendation Engine**

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jdmendoza/startup_recommendation_engine) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jdmendoza/startup_recommendation_engine/blob/master/Startup_Recommender.ipynb)

Description: Used K-Means clustering + NLP techniques on 20014-2014 CrunchBase data to recommend SF startups for job-seekers and investors. Rather than using a rigid approach like CrunchBase's search engine (filtering with rules), my engine uses an exploratory approach.


**Pricing Tool for Used-iPhone **

[GitHub](https://github.com/jdmendoza/used_iphone_price_prediction) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jdmendoza/used_iphone_price_prediction/blob/master/3_Modeling_Data.ipynb)

Description: I webscraped data of recently sold iPhones on [Swappa](https://swappa.com/buy/iphones). I used the data to train a linear regression model to predict a the value of an iPhone. I achieved an R2 of 0.97 and a standard error of $34.

**Predicting Startup Success**

[GitHub](https://github.com/jdmendoza/predicting_startup_success) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jdmendoza/predicting_startup_success/blob/master/Danny_SF_Startup_Acquisition.ipynb)

Description: Using Crunchbase data from 2004 - 2014, my partner Nazim and I investigated the important features that may help predict whether a startup will succeed.


**Gods Unchained Project**

Description: I performed  webscraping on a card game webpage and visualized the data to investigate the effects of allowing players to directly buy card packs containing specific card rarities.
