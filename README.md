## **Data Exploration Projects**

### Gods Unchained Project
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/jdmendoza/jdmendoza.github.io/tree/master/card_distribution)

Description: I performed  webscraping on a card game webpage and visualized the data to investigate the effects of allowing players to directly buy card packs containing specific card rarities.

1. Game Website: [God's Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/?refcode=0x07453584C359A2b95fe115CC5eA72c56eEFE3Ee2)
2. Medium post explaining my observations: [Relative Value Of Cards In Gods Unchained](https://medium.com/@jdannym93/relative-value-of-cards-in-gods-unchained-b875a1cee7e0)  
3. Medium post explaining my data pipeline and code walkthrough: [Web-scraping and Analyzing Gods Unchained Card Data](https://medium.com/@jdannym93/web-scraping-and-analyzing-gods-unchained-card-data-1087b9fcd734). 
4. Community Requested Card Visualization: [Existing Legendaries & Epics](https://godsunchained.herokuapp.com/).

## **Machine Learning Projects**

### Credit Card Fraud 
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/jdmendoza/jdmendoza.github.io/tree/master/credit_card_fraud)

Description: This project used the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://github.com/jdmendoza/jdmendoza.github.io/tree/master/credit_card_fraud) . I trained a logistic regression model to detect instances of credit card fraud in the data. 

### Titanic Dataset
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/jdmendoza/jdmendoza.github.io/tree/master/titanic_dataset)

Description: This project uses the [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) . I trained two different machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, decision tree) to predict if a person died or survived. 

1. Input a person's data and see if they would survive: [Webpage](http://dannymendoza.pythonanywhere.com/)

### Boston Housing Project
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/jdmendoza/jdmendoza.github.io/tree/master/boston_housing)

Description: This project uses the [Kaggle Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing) . I trained a linear regression model to predict housing price.
