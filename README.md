# Data Science Repository by Danny Mendoza

This is my portfolio of data science projects. For each project there is a link to the GitHub repo, a short project description and any accompanying documentation:

## **Data Exploration Projects**

### Gods Unchained Project
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/jdmendoza/jdmendoza.github.io/tree/master/card_distribution)

Description: I used webscraping and data visualization to investigate the effects of allowing players to directly buy packs containing specific card rarities.

## **Machine Learning Projects**

### Credit Card Fraud 
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/jdmendoza/jdmendoza.github.io/tree/master/credit_card_fraud)

Description: This project used the  [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://github.com/jdmendoza/jdmendoza.github.io/tree/master/credit_card_fraud) . I trained a logistic regression model to detect instances of credit card fraud in the data. 

### Titanic Dataset
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/jdmendoza/jdmendoza.github.io/tree/master/titanic_dataset)

Description: This project uses the [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) . I trained a two different machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, decision tree) to predict if a person died or survived. 

1. Coming soon: Webpage that uses the trained model to determine if a person (user entered) would have survived the Titanic.
