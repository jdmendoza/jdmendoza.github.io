## **Machine Learning Projects**
---
### [Deep Learning to Forecast Wikipedia Page Views](https://github.com/jdmendoza/wikipedia_time_series_forecasting)

Description: With two years worth of page-view data for 145k wikipedia pages, I condensed this into 8 different time series based on page language and training one LSTM to forecast for the 8 different time series.

### [Startup Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/jdmendoza/startup_recommendation_engine)

Description: Used K-Means clustering + NLP techniques on 20014-2014 CrunchBase data to recommend SF startups for job-seekers and investors. Rather than using a rigid approach like CrunchBase's search engine (filtering with rules), my engine uses an exploratory approach.


### [Music Lyric Generator](https://github.com/jdmendoza/rap_lyrics_generator_lstm)

Description: I trained an LSTM with webscraped lyrics to generate lyrics in the style on an rap artist.  

### [Pricing Tool for Used-iPhone](https://github.com/jdmendoza/used_iphone_price_prediction)

Description: I webscraped data of recently sold iPhones on [Swappa](https://swappa.com/buy/iphones). I used the data to train a linear regression model to predict a the value of an iPhone. I achieved an R2 of 0.97 and a standard error of $34.

### [Predicting Startup Success](https://github.com/jdmendoza/predicting_startup_success)

Description: Using Crunchbase data from 2004 - 2014, my partner Nazim and I investigated the important features that may help predict whether a startup will succeed.

## **Data Exploration Projects**
---
### [Gods Unchained Project](https://github.com/jdmendoza/jdmendoza.github.io/tree/master/card_distribution)

Description: I performed  webscraping on a card game webpage and visualized the data to investigate the effects of allowing players to directly buy card packs containing specific card rarities.
