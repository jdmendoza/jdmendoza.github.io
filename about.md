**Bio.** Data scientist and machine learning engineer. Previously, I was a data scientist fellow at Metis where I worked on projects like deep learning for time series data, clustering methods for [startup recommendation](https://jdmendoza.github.io/2019/02/07/discover-startups.html) and an [iPhone resale tool](https://jdmendoza.github.io/2018/10/14/iphone-tool.html). Before that I was an applications engineer at ON Semiconductor where I helped in hardware design and automation + data analysis. I graduated from Santa Clara University with my BSEE in 2015 and MSEE in 2016 with my specialization in control theory. My advisor was [Dr. Maryam Khanbaghi](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/khanbaghi-maryam/).

I hope you find something interesting in here. Feel free to tweet me, email me, LinkedIn message.
