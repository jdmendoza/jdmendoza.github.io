title: Data Science Blog Compiler
---


I love that the data science community is so open about sharing their ideas and projects through their blogs.
It is, however, annoying to have to navigate to each bloggers website every week to check for new materials.
To solve this problem, I created a simple website that scrapes the five most recent blog posts and display the title with a link.

Check it out here: [dsblogs](https://dsblogs.herokuapp.com/).

Notes:
- I plan on adding more blogs, which are your favorite?
