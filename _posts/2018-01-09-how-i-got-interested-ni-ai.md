# How I Got Interested In AI

As the eldest of five boys, I have seen the developmental process and learning that takes place during infancy and childhood many times. The speed of this process has always fascinated me. It takes about three years before a child can understand the idea of order/sorting, which starts with sorting objects by shape and color. A year later they can draw circles and squares. Only a year after that, they begin counting ten objects or more. Check out the childhood milestones table from WebMD:

I had the privilege of witnessing and participating in this process four different times. As they learned, I loved sharing little mathematical, physics or engineering insights with them before they had a chance to think it was boring. Every time, I was so amazed at the rate of learning and intrigued in the process behind it. How does learning take place? Can computers do the same thing? How can that benefit people? Most would approach this with a psychological or neuroscientific point of view, instead, I was interested in a mathematics/engineering approach.
This mentality led me to electrical engineering, where I focused on control theory. The main idea in control theory is to model a system mathematically, design a stabilizing controller and build "smarts" on top of it. This allows for some aspect of learning, but it is very rigid and does not allow mistakes. This is by design since you wouldn't want your power supply to become unstable and blow up! This type of design is quite powerful, in fact, it is suspected that Boston Dynamics uses this approach for their robots and they do amazing things!

Check out their robot, Atlas:

Humans make mistakes and are encouraged to do so, in order to learn and grow. It makes sense that this approach should somehow be implemented in teaching a machine to have intelligence. The algorithms make mistakes during training and through correction, they can do something useful. This seems to be the right direction! A kid falls hundreds of times before they can successfully waddle to the sofa. I remember falling off of my bike many many times before successfully riding around.
These past two years, I have dedicated my free time to study, and understand these powerful algorithms. Like a kid, I have stumbled through some of the subjects, but after deliberate practice and focus, I improved and learned. My goal is to use ML to provide value to people. This blog is dedicated to sharing projects that I have worked on, interesting insights I come across and other random cool things.
