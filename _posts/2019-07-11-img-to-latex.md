Using Deep Learning To Convert Images Of Equations To LaTeX

A couple months ago, I signed up for an applied deep learning course hosted by [Weights and Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) in San Francisco. The course consisted of lectures that went over topics such as tooling, infrastructure, codebase practices, troubleshooting deep learning systems and amazing guest lectures from Uber AI's[Rosanne Liu](https://eng.uber.com/author/rosanne-liu/), Berkley AI Professor [Pieter Abbeel](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/abbeel.html), Weights and Biases founder [Lukas Biewald](https://lukasbiewald.com/) and many others.

One objective of the course was to tackle a deep learning problem and implement the ideas we learned in class with a team. My team worked on an OpenAI request for research, the image to LaTeX problem. The company featured the project on their website,[Check it out!](https://www.wandb.com/articles/image-to-latex)
