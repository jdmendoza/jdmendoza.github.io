title: Applied Deep Learning - Im2LaTeX
---

A couple months ago, I signed up for an applied deep learning course hosted by [Weights and Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) in San Francisco. The course consisted of lectures that went over topics such as tooling, infrastructure, codebase practices and troubleshooting deep learning systems. Additionally, we had guest lecturers give talks on various topics like research areas, coming up with ML projects and grading an ML project. Some of the guests were:

- Uber AI's [Rosanne Liu](https://eng.uber.com/author/rosanne-liu/)
- Berkley AI Professor [Pieter Abbeel](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/abbeel.html)
- Weights and Biases founder [Lukas Biewald](https://lukasbiewald.com/)
- and many others.

An objective of the course was to tackle a deep learning problem and implement the ideas we learned in class. My team worked on an OpenAI request for research, the image to LaTeX problem. Weights and Biases featured our project on their website, [Check it out!](https://www.wandb.com/articles/image-to-latex)
