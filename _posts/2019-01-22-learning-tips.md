## Intro
This weekend, I watched a few videos on learning techniques by an awesome Youtuber named [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/user/Sepharoth64). It was a series of three videos which cover effective study techniques that are backed by evidence. I began writing a short summary to send to my brothers, but figured that this might benefit other people, so I’ll turn it into a post.

## Understanding vs Remembering
An important distinction in the process of learning is the difference between understanding and remembering. Understanding is being able to think about a topic/concept, know how ideas within that topic connect, and have the ability to apply the concepts to solve problems. For example, knowing how to manipulate a physics equation to solve a problem or choosing the best method of treatment for patient. Remembering, on the other hand, is about the ability to retrieve information when the thinker needs it. Both of these are required to effectively use ideas, whether that be on an exam or at work.

Before I go into these powerful techniques, I’d like to share some commonly used techniques that have been proven to not work.

## What Doesn’t Work
Here are some surprising techniques that many people love to use, but are **NOT** efficient methods to learn material.
- Highlighting: it is very easy to mindlessly highlight words and not absorb the material.
- Rereading: increases in retention are marginal and it takes a long time.
- Taking Notes: easy to focus on the action of note-taking itself then on the material.

## First Time Understanding
The first step in learning a subject is try and make sense of the ideas that are being communicated to you.

Some techniques help do this:
- Quiz Yourself: When learning material for the first time, stop and quiz yourself with questions about the text you are reading and see if you are able to answer them.
- Closed Book Diagrams: Create [mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) to visually show how you are thinking about the material. First do it without the book, then use the book to correct errors.
- [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/): Try explaining the subject/topic as if you were talking to a 5 year old.

Once it is understood as much as possible, you can use the active recall and spaced repetition techniques to connect the various topics in a subject and increase further understanding and remembrance.

## Active Recall
The most efficient way to learn (both understand and remember) is by deliberately digging into your brain’s archives and retrieving ideas. Active recall is giving yourself little quizzes or tests to have your brain dig into it’s library and pull out the information. Just by testing yourself, you strengthen the connections in your brain to understand and remember the material.

Some techniques to apply this idea:
- Flashcards: Helps to quickly retrieve facts, but not so much connect ideas
- Closed Book Mind Map: Forces you to think about the ideas you are learning and how they relate.
- Review Questions: Rather than taking explicit notes, write down questions and study by answering these questions.

## Spaced Repetition
The next powerful technique is very useful for remembering material. This technique is used to combat the forgetting curve, which essentially says that after we learn a topic, the rate that we forget stuff happens faster and faster. The secret is to review the topic but allow longer and longer intervals of time between revisions. For example, three hours after you learn it, then one week, then one month. This works by continuously interrupting the forgetting curve and locking in the ideas to our long term memory.

Some techniques to apply this idea:
- Breakup Your Studying: Learn the material in the early part of the day, but don’t do homework/study until after some time has passed. Interweave other subjects if you want to be time efficient.
- Spreadsheet: Create a spreadsheet with each topic in a subject that you want to learn from and every time you review it (by active recall!) add the date and color it to show how well you did. Ali calls this method his “magical spreadsheet method”.

## Conclusion
As a data scientist trying to become an expert in the field, I am reviewing a bunch of topics I covered in college and also teaching myself new materials. I have a large stack of books on my desk and many video files on my computer that I am chugging through. I definitely plan on applying these techniques during my studying.
